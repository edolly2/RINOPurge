        At RINOPurge, we believe the Republican Party should stand firmly on
        conservative values—defending freedom, promoting fiscal responsibility,
        securing our borders, and protecting the Constitution. Unfortunately,
        not every Republican in office holds the line. Too often, we see
        so-called “Republicans In Name Only” (RINOs) siding with big-government
        policies, compromising core principles, and failing to represent the
        voters who put them in office. Our mission is simple but urgent: Expose
        RINOs, Educate Voters, and Energize Primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Expose RINOs – We shine a spotlight on Republicans who vote against
        conservative values, break campaign promises, or cave to political
        pressure. Through clear data, voting records, and issue analysis, we
        make it easy to see who’s standing with conservatives—and who’s not.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Educate Voters – We give citizens the tools to understand what’s at
        stake. By breaking down policies, highlighting key votes, and tracking
        trends, we provide the facts necessary to make informed decisions at the
        ballot box.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Energize Primaries – The best way to hold RINOs accountable is to
        challenge them in the primaries. We’re here to fuel enthusiasm for
        principled challengers who will fight for conservative values and put
        the power back in the hands of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t just about politics—it’s about preserving the integrity of
        the Republican Party and ensuring it remains a voice for the people, not
        the establishment. Together, we can reclaim the party, reinvigorate the
        conservative movement, and elect leaders who won’t back down. Join us.
        Hold the line. Take back the party.
